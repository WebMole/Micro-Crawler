<h1>Readme</h1>

<p>A web site with one PHP session variable. The variable is reset when
visiting <tt>index.php</tt>, inverted when visiting <tt>page2.php</tt> and
<tt>page7.php</tt>. The contents of <tt>page1.php</tt> depends on the value
of the session variable: it displays links to pages 2-3-4 if it is not set,
and to pages 5-6-7 if it is set.</p>

<p>Hence, pages 3-4 can only be accessed if
the session variable is not set, and the opposite for 6-7. Trying to access
these pages with the incorrect value of the session variable results in the
application returning a 404 HTTP error response. This is similar to e.g. GitHub,
which returns a 404 when one tries to access a page that needs login without
being logged.</p>

<p>Any application that uses backtracking will fail to explore the site
properly.  After visiting page2, any backtracking to page1 will yield
a page with <em>different</em> links than the first time it was visited:
the page one receives is not the one that is expected. A sound crawler should
identify this discrepancy and fail. This is the case of VanillaWsm and BacktrackWsm.
A proper exploration with the NoBacktrackWsm yields
the following graph:</p>
